# Aph
The repo for my tiny AI/Chatbot project, Aph. This is the currently under-development node version.
The name means Anthropomorphizing Parodist Heuristic bot (inspired by [HAL 9000's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000#Origin_of_name)).

# Use
To run, simply download the source code and start `RUN.bat` or do `node path_to_folder/aph.js`
Typing messages into the program console will cause Aph to respond to and store/learn from your responses.

# !help
This is the help command output:
* `!h / !help` : Looks like you found this one
* `!m / !memory` : Output memory data
* `!ms / !memorysize` : Output memory size (based on the amount of keys stored in json)
* `!r / !reset` : Reset program to initial state
* `!f / !forget` : Forget all memory data
* `!c / !clear` : Clear console
* `!sl / !shouldlearn` : Toggle learning on or off
* `!s / !save` : Save memory to save.json
* `!ld / !load` : Load memory from save.json
